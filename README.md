## Description
The ARC-AGI (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus - Artificial General Intelligence) benchmark is a dataset created by Fran√ßois Chollet to test AI's ability for abstract reasoning. It consists of a series of tasks based on colored grids, where the AI must infer rules and transformations from a few examples without explicit instructions.
ARC is designed to assess human-like cognitive skills such as generalization, analogy, and pattern recognition, posing a challenge for traditional machine learning models. The benchmark is considered a key test for measuring progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
